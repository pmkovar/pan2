    This is Pan, a powerful and user-friendly Usenet newsreader for GTK+.
    The latest information and versions of Pan can always be found at
    <http://pan.rebelbase.com/>.


RELEASE NOTES

        * You are advised to back up your $PAN_HOME directory (by default,
          '$HOME/.pan2') before upgrading Pan.

        * If you have previously been using a localhost server with stunnel and
          you now want to connect directly to a news server using the actual
          server address, do not create a new configuration entry for the
          server. Pan treats a new entry as a new server and does not preserve
          existing data on your subscribed groups, even though you are
          connecting to the very same server as before. Always edit the existing
          server configuration to preserve your subscriptions.

        * Directories to search for SSL certificates can be defined with
          environment variables 'SSL_CERT_DIR' or 'SSL_DIR'.

        * Even if support for GNOME Keyring has been enabled at configure time
          and compiled in, you can explicitly configure GNOME Keyring support
          in the Pan Preferences. To enable support, go to Edit -> Preferences
          -> Miscellaneous and check 'Store passwords in GNOME Keyring'.

THE SALES PITCH

    Pan is good for Reading News.

        * Pan is the only Unix newsreader to score 100% on the
          Good Net-Keeping Seal of Approval newsreader evaluations.
        * Pan has keyboard bindings for mouse-free newsreading.
        * Basic newsreader features, such as reading and writing news,
          threading articles, and replying via email, are supported.
        * Articles can be sorted by author, date, subject, or the number
          of unread children in the thread.
        * Multiple connections are supported, so articles can be read
          while binaries are downloading.
        * Articles can be filtered by regular expression matching,
          read/unread state, binary/text, etc.
        * Works well as an offline reader.
        * Articles can be queued until you want to go online, and can be
          re-edited at any point before they're posted.
        * A flexible rules system allows you to delete, hide, download,
          or notify you of, etc. articles that match a subject, or are
          posted by a particular user, and so on.
        * The same system can be used to define automatic actions on behalf
          of the user: auto-download, auto-cache, auto-delete etc.
        * Groups can be filtered by regular expression matching
          subscribed/new/all, etc.

    Pan is good at Binaries.

        * Attached images can be shown inline.
        * Pan can download and thread articles as quickly as bandwidth allows.
        * uuencode, MIME, and yEnc attachments are all supported.
        * A task manager lets you reorder, cancel, and resubmit download tasks.
        * Multiple connections are supported, so many binaries can
          be downloaded simultaneously.
        * Multipart articles are automatically grouped together.
        * Non-binary, incomplete multipart, and saved messages can be filtered
          out of the article list.
        * Files can be attached to a Usenet article and are
          automatically encrypted with yEnc, threaded and referenced by Pan.
        * Articles can be encrypted or signed with a public or private PGP key
          for enhanced privacy and security.
        * Connections can be encrypted with the TLS 1.0 protocol.
